# PREDICTING THE PERCENTAGE SCORE OF STUDENTS
The goal is to develop a Machine Learning Model using the given Data Set & Predict the Percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they study.

Model Developed :
Simple Linear Regression

Tools Used:
Python

Python Libraries used:
1.Numpy
2.Pandas
3.Seaborn
4.Matplotlib
5.Sklearn
6.Statsmodels

Assumptions :
1.No student studies for more than 10 hours. The predicted percentage score exceeds 100.
2.The Distribution is approximated to be Normal.
3.No other variable affects the Target variable but the independent variable provided in the Data Set. There is no Omitted Variable Bias.
